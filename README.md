# Overview

This is a python interface for the Raspberry Pi+ LoRa(TM) Expansion Board by Uputronics (https://store.uputronics.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=61&product_id=68).
This board uses the Hope RFâ€™s patented LoRaTM modulation technique RFM95/96/97/98(W) 

The code is derived and adapted from: https://github.com/mayeranalytics/pySX127x with the help of the indications in: https://electron-tinker.blogspot.com.es/2016/08/raspberry-pi-lora-hoperf-python-code.html

# Installation

Make sure SPI is activated on you RaspberryPi: [SPI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/spi/README.md)
**pyUputronics** requires these two python packages:
* [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO") for accessing the GPIOs, it should be already installed on
  a standard Raspian Linux image
* [spidev](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spidev) for controlling SPI

In order to install spidev download the source code and run setup.py manually:
```bash
wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/spidev/spidev-3.1.tar.gz
tar xfvz  spidev-3.1.tar.gz
cd spidev-3.1
sudo python setup.py install
```

At this point you may want to confirm that the unit tests pass. 

For example, you can run the scripts `lora_util.py` that dumps the registers.
```bash
rasp$ sudo ./lora_util.py
hoperf LoRa registers:
 mode               SLEEP
 freq               434.000000 MHz
 coding_rate        CR4_5
 bw                 BW125
 spreading_factor   128 chips/symb
 implicit_hdr_mode  OFF
 ... and so on ....
```

### Continuous receiver `rx_cont.py`
The hoperf is put in RXCONT mode and continuously waits for transmissions. Upon a successful read the
payload and the irq flags are printed to screen.
```
usage: sudo ./rx_cont.py [-h] [--ocp OCP] [--sf SF] [--freq FREQ] [--bw BW]
                  [--cr CODING_RATE] [--preamble PREAMBLE]

# Code Examples

### Overview
First import the modules 
```python
from hoperf.LoRa import *
from hoperf.board_config import BOARD
```
then set up the board GPIOs
```python
BOARD.setup()
```
The LoRa object is instantiated and put into the standby mode
```python
lora = LoRa()
lora.set_mode(MODE.STDBY)
```
Registers are queried like so:
```python
print lora.version()        # this prints the hoperf chip version
print lora.get_freq()       # this prints the frequency setting 
```
and setting registers is easy, too
```python
lora.set_freq(433.0)       # Set the frequency to 433 MHz 
```
In applications the `LoRa` class should be subclassed while overriding one or more of the callback functions that
are invoked on successful RX or TX operations, for example.
```python
class MyLoRa(LoRa):

  def __init__(self, verbose=False):
    super(MyLoRa, self).__init__(verbose)
    # setup registers etc.

  def on_rx_done(self):
    payload = self.read_payload(nocheck=True) 
    # etc.
```

In the end the resources should be freed properly
```python
BOARD.teardown()
```

### More details
Most functions of `hoperf.Lora` are setter and getter functions. For example, the setter and getter for 
the coding rate are demonstrated here
```python 
print lora.get_coding_rate()                # print the current coding rate
lora.set_coding_rate(CODING_RATE.CR4_6)     # set it to CR4_6
```


# Class Reference

The interface to the hoperf LoRa modem is implemented in the class `hoperf.LoRa.LoRa`.
The most important modem configuration parameters are:
 
| Function         | Description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| set_mode         | Change OpMode, use the constants.MODE class |
| set_freq         | Set the frequency                           |
| set_bw           | Set the bandwidth 7.8kHz ... 500kHz         |
| set_coding_rate  | Set the coding rate 4/5, 4/6, 4/7, 4/8      |
| | |
| @todo            |                              |

Most set_* functions have a mirror get_* function, but beware that the getter return types do not necessarily match 
the setter input types.

### Register naming convention
The register addresses are defined in class `hoperf.constants.REG` and we use a specific naming convention which 
is best illustrated by a few examples:

| Register | Modem | Semtech doc.      | pyUputronics                   |
|----------|-------|-------------------| ---------------------------|
| 0x0E     | LoRa  | RegFifoTxBaseAddr | REG.LORA.FIFO_TX_BASE_ADDR |
| 0x0E     | FSK   | RegRssiCOnfig     | REG.FSK.RSSI_CONFIG        |
| 0x1D     | LoRa  | RegModemConfig1   | REG.LORA.MODEM_CONFIG_1    |
| etc.     |       |                   |                            |

### Hardware
Hardware related definition and initialisation are located in `hoperf.board_config.BOARD`.
If you use a SBC other than the Raspberry Pi you'll have to adapt the BOARD class.

# Roadmap

### Semtech SX1272/3 vs. SX1276/7/8/9
**pyUputronics** is not entirely compatible with the 1272.
The 1276 and 1272 chips are different and the interfaces not 100% identical. For example registers 0x26/27. 
But the pyUputronics library should get you pretty far if you use it with care. Here are the two datasheets:
* [Semtech - SX1276/77/78/79 - 137 MHz to 1020 MHz Low Power Long Range Transceiver](http://www.semtech.com/images/datasheet/sx1276_77_78_79.pdf)
* [Semtech SX1272/73 - 860 MHz to 1020 MHz Low Power Long Range Transceiver](http://www.semtech.com/images/datasheet/sx1272.pdf)

### HopeRF transceiver ICs ###
HopeRF has a family of LoRa capable transceiver chips [RFM92/95/96/98](http://www.hoperf.com/)
that have identical or almost identical SPI interface as the Semtech SX1276/7/8/9 family.

### Microchip transceiver IC ###
Likewise Microchip has the chip [RN2483](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/50002346A.pdf)

# LoRaWAN
LoRaWAN is a LPWAN (low power WAN) and, and  **pyUputronics** has almost no relationship with LoRaWAN. Here we only deal with the interface into the chip(s) that enable the physical layer of LoRaWAN networks.
